PRPLDMinecraft
==============
PRPLD Minecraft is a tailored version for the Poudre River Public Library District.

Early development started in October 2013. Since then, we have learn a great deal about configurations, plugins, customizations and more.

Installed Plugins:

- Essentials
- Grief Prevention
- World Edit
- Permissions

In its current state, the code is ready to clone and play out of the box. The installed plugins offered a safe environment for users and operators within the game app to configure, manage and secure several elements to ensure a great experience for players.

More details will be coming soon. -- VZ
